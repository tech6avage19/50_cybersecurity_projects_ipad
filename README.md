# üõ°Ô∏è 50+ Cybersecurity Projects from an iPad

> Built by Joshua Birdine  
> Real-world labs built, tested, and documented entirely from an iPad.  
> ‚úÖ GitHub-first, mobile-ready, and designed for practical, portfolio-grade results.

## Foundations

- [Build a cloud-based home lab on AWS EC2](./foundations/01_cloud_lab_aws)
- Harden your Linux server (UFW, SSH keys, root disable)
- Set up custom DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH/DoT)
- Deploy a VPN server (WireGuard / Algo VPN)
- Configure secure remote backups (S3 + encryption)
- Deploy Docker and run isolated containers
- Host your personal lab dashboard/static site (HTTPS)
- Spin up a local Pi-hole DNS blocker via cloud
- Set up an encrypted personal Git server
- Use Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel to secure exposed services

## System-Hardening

- Run a full port scan on your cloud VM (nmap)
- Disable unused services + open ports on Linux
- Set up fail2ban for SSH brute-force protection
- Automate system patching + update notifications
- Create a hardened SSH config template
- Implement MFA for SSH using Google Authenticator
- Create a privacy-focused browser VM w/ hardened DNS + Tor
- Lock down cloud metadata access (AWS IMDSv2)

## Defensive-Security

- Detect MITM attacks on your network (arp-scan, whois)
- Monitor for DNS leaks (dnsleaktest + dig analysis)
- Set up log monitoring + alerting using a bash script
- Block suspicious IP ranges from your cloud firewall
- Use Suricata or Zeek to monitor traffic in real time
- Build a simple honeypot (e.g. Cowrie) in your VM
- Install ClamAV for malware scanning
- Create a simple IDS/IPS test setup using Snort or Wazuh agent
- Use file integrity monitoring to detect tampering
  
## Offensive-Security

- Run a vulnerable web app (DVWA / Juice Shop) safely
- Scan a site for open ports & weak ciphers (nmap + sslscan)
- Host a phishing simulation lab (GoPhish)
- Create a fake login page & phishing alert system
- Perform a basic SQL Injection on test DVWA
- Simulate a dictionary attack on SSH (safe lab only)
- Run password cracking on test hashes (hashcat/cloud)
- Bypass weak login systems using HTTP intercept tools
- Use OSINT tools to gather data on domains or emails
- Enumerate subdomains with tools like Sublist3r
  
## SOC-Playbooks

- Set up Wazuh agent + configure log-based alerts
- Forward logs to a remote log server or GitHub backup
- Monitor auth logs and auto-ban repeat offenders
- Build a threat feed parser from public sources
- Display alerts in a terminal dashboard (Glances, Tmux + Logs)
- Correlate logs manually from fail2ban + SSH logs
- Script a ‚Äúrisk score‚Äù based on user behavior in logs
- Build a mini-SIEM dashboard using shell and cron
  
## AI-Security

- Create a personal threat model and risk map
- Build a bash script to automate server deployment
- Write a self-healing bash script (auto-restarts failed services)
- Use ChatGPT or local AI models to help triage logs
- Build a ‚ÄúSecurity Checklist‚Äù generator script
- Create a public GitHub portfolio with all 50+ projects
- Share weekly project breakdowns on YouTube/Twitter/LinkedIn
- Add QR codes linking to your GitHub or portfolio from videos
- Build your own offline security cheatsheet system (Markdown)
- Start a personal newsletter from your iPad w/ project updates
